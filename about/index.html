  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>Hello! I'm Suraj, a passionate developer and lifelong learner. Welcome to my blog!</p>

  <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
  <p>
    I am a developer currently based in Leeds, UK. Originally from Pune, India, I have a diverse educational background that includes a Master of Science degree in Management and a diploma in Data Science. My journey started in mechanical engineering, but my passion for data and technology led me to the exciting fields of data science and machine learning.
  </p>

  <h2>My Journey</h2>
  <p>
    My career path has been quite diverse. Starting with a solid foundation in mechanical engineering, I moved into the business and management arena, where I honed my analytical and strategic skills. My growing interest in data and its power to drive decisions inspired me to dive into data science. Over the years, I've worked on various projects that combine my technical and managerial expertise, continuously learning and adapting to new challenges.
  </p>

  <h2>What I Do</h2>
  <p>
    Currently, I am focused on mastering machine learning and aim to become an expert in this field. I enjoy coding in Python and have a particular interest in applying machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems. My goal is to secure a role as a business analyst, data analyst, or data scientist where I can leverage my skills to make a significant impact.
  </p>

  <h2>Beyond Tech</h2>
  <p>
    Outside of the tech world, I have a variety of interests. I enjoy exploring new places, experiencing different cultures, and staying active through sports and outdoor activities. I also love spending time with family and friends, and I am always up for a good book or an interesting movie.
  </p>
