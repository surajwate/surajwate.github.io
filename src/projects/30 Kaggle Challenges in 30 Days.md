## Project Overview

Welcome to my 30 Kaggle Challenges in 30 Days project! I've set out to solve 30 Kaggle Playground problems over the next 30 days. The goal isn't just to hit the finish line but to dive deep into different aspects of data science and machine learning, from data wrangling to building models and feature engineering.

This project is all about challenging myself to think creatively and improve my skills by solving Kaggle playground problems. It's not just about getting the perfect result but about learning, experimenting, and pushing myself with each new challenge.


## Why This Challenge?

I've always been passionate about problem-solving and data-driven insights. Kaggle's Playground Series offers a fantastic platform to take on fun, low-pressure problems while continuously growing and learning. For me, this challenge is a way to:

- Stay motivated and focused.
- Explore new techniques and approaches.
- Get creative with data.
- Learn from mistakes and iterate quickly.


## Challenge Structure

Over the course of these 30 days, I'll be diving into a variety of problems, including:

- Binary Classification
- Regression
- Time Series Forecasting
- Multiclass Classification
- Feature Engineering and Selection
- Model Tuning and Hyperparameter Optimization


Each day, I will focus on a specific Kaggle Playground problem and document my approach, insights, challenges, and results for each one.


## What to Expect

- **Daily Blog Posts**: I'll be sharing a blog post for each challenge, detailing the problem, my approach, and what I learned.
- **Code and Notebooks**: The code for each problem will be shared through GitHub and linked in each post.
- **Reflection**: After the 30 days, I'll reflect on the overall experience - what worked, what didn't, and how I grew as a data scientist.


### Day 1: [Binary Classification of Insurance Cross Selling](https://surajwate.com/blog/binary-classification-of-insurance-cross-selling/)

**Description**: Tackling the first challenge! Today's problem is focused on binary classification for insurance cross-selling.

**Notebook**: [Kaggle Notebook for S4E7](https://www.kaggle.com/code/surajwate/s4e7-insurance-cross-selling)
**Code**: [GitHub Repository for Day 1](https://github.com/surajwate/S4E7-Insurance-Cross-Selling)


### Day 2: [Classification with an Academic Success Dataset](https://surajwate.com/blog/classification-with-an-academic-success-dataset/)

**Description**: Build classification model to predict students' dropout and academic success. The problem is formulated as a three category classification task, with a significant class imbalance. I applied stratified K-fold cross-validation and tried multiple models to optimize performance.

**Notebook**: [Kaggle Notebook for S4E6](https://www.kaggle.com/code/surajwate/academic-success-xgboost)
**Code**: [GitHub Repository for Day 2](https://github.com/surajwate/S4E6-Academic-Success)

## Conclusion 

This journey is not just about solving 30 problems, but about embracing the learning process, enjoying the challenge, and exploring different data science techniques. Feel free to follow along, and I hope to inspire others who are passionate about data science to take on similar challenges.
