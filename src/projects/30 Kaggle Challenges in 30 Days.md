## Project Overview

Welcome to my 30 Kaggle Challenges in 30 Days project! This journey is all about challenging myself to solve 30 Kaggle Playground problems in 30 days. Each challenge will offer a new learning experience, pushing me to explore different aspects of data science and machine learning, from data preprocessing to model building, feature engineering, and beyond.

This project is driven by my personal interest in tackling real-world problems and sharpening my skills hands-on. It's not just about the results but about the process of learning, experimenting, and improving with each step.


## Why This Challenge?

I've always been passionate about problem-solving and data-driven insights. Kaggle's Playground Series offers a fantastic platform to take on fun, low-pressure problems while continuously growing and learning. For me, this challenge is a way to:

- Stay motivated and focused.
- Explore new techniques and approaches.
- Get creative with data.
- Learn from mistakes and iterate quickly.


## Challenge Structure

Over the course of these 30 days, I'll be diving into a variety of problems, including:

- Binary Classification
- Regression
- Time Series Forecasting
- Multiclass Classification
- Feature Engineering and Selection
- Model Tuning and Hyperparameter Optimization


Each day, I will focus on a specific Kaggle Playground problem and document my approach, insights, challenges, and results for each one.


## What to Expect

- **Daily Blog Posts**: I'll be sharing a blog post for each challenge, detailing the problem, my approach, and what I learned.
- **Code and Notebooks**: The code for each problem will be shared through GitHub and linked in each post.
- **Reflection**: After the 30 days, I'll reflect on the overall experience - what worked, what didn't, and how I grew as a data scientist.


### Day 1: [Binary Classification of Insurance Cross Selling](https://surajwate.com/blog/binary-classification-of-insurance-cross-selling/)

**Description**: Tackling the first challenge! Today's problem is focused on binary classification for insurance cross-selling.

## Conclusion 

This journey is not just about solving 30 problems, but about embracing the learning process, enjoying the challenge, and exploring different data science techniques. Feel free to follow along, and I hope to inspire others who are passionate about data science to take on similar challenges.
