## Project Overview

DataLab is a data science library/package I am developing to simplify the process of building machine learning models. Previously, I wrote custom Python code for each project, but this became repetitive and time-consuming. To streamline my workflow and save time, I decided to build this package and release it on PyPI. By doing so, the package is readily available whenever I start a new project, eliminating the need to copy and paste code repeatedly.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Automate the detection and removal of outliers. 
- **Feature Engineering**: Generate new features with a single command. 
- **Visualization**: Create complex visualizations with minimal code.

## Documentation
